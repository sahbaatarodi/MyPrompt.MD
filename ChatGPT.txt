what is a class in javascript ?

In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects 
with shared properties and methods. It provides a way to define a 
type of object and encapsulate related functionality. 
Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to make it 
easier to work with object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.

Here's a basic example of a class in JavaScript:

class Animal {
  // Constructor method to initialize object properties
  constructor(name, sound) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sound = sound;
  }

  // Method to make the animal produce its sound
  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says ${this.sound}`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Animal class
const cat = new Animal('Cat', 'Meow');

// Using the makeSound method of the cat object
cat.makeSound(); // Output: Cat says Meow
